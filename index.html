 <div id="explanation">
  <p> The first chart shows three different types of crime and how often they occurred from 1999 to 2018. Robbery, aggrevated assault and motor vehicle theft have all become less common since 1999. Motor vehicle theft is the most common offense of the three, and it peaked in 2003 with over 1.26 million offenses. Aggravated assualt passed motor vehicle theft in offenses in 2009 and continues to be more common. Robbery is by far the least common of the three crimes and has declined in recent years. </p>
  <p> The second chart is a scatter plot of the violent crime rates every year from 1999 to 2018. I wanted to see if there were any potential outliers in the data from year to year, but it does not look like there are any. However, it does show that violent crime rates have mostly decreased every year since 1999 aside from a couple of small year-to-year increases. Violent crime rates never surpassed the 1999 total of 523 violent crimes per 100,000 people. The lowest they ever were was in 2014 when there were just 361.6 violent crimes per 100,000 people. </p> </div>
